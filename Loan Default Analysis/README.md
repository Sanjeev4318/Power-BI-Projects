# Loan Default Analysis - Power BI ðŸ“Š
In this project I have used data flow as the data source and i have used the loan default dataset. 
It is a three page report and here you can see that I have used line charts, ribbon chart, decomposition tree chart and donut charts.

## Data Source : Dataflows (Setting Up Dataflows)

To use dataflows we need gateway as well. To set up dataflows I followed below steps:
### Steps:
- Login to the power bi account.
- Create a new workspace, creared the workspace named Loan Default Analysis.
- Click on download and then click on Data Gateway to download the gateway. I have downloaded the standard mode gateway.
- I have named the gateway as DF1 representing the dataflows.
- I have imported the data to Microsoft SQL server and we will use SQL to create dataflows.
- The dataset table name is Loan_default
- Click on workspaces and then click on Loan Default Analysis, Now click on New Item and search Dataflows and then we have two options Gen one and Gen two.
- For this project i have used Gen one
- Then click on Add New Tables and select SQL server and provide the details to connect then click on next and select the loan_default table.
- I have named it as "DataflowsSQL_loan"
