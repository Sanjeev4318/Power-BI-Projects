# Loan Default Analysis - Power BI ðŸ“Š
In this project I have used data flow as the data source and i have used the loan default dataset. 
It is a three page report and here you can see that I have used line charts, ribbon chart, decomposition tree chart and donut charts.

### First Page: Loan Default Overview

## Data Source : Dataflows (Setting Up Dataflows)

To use dataflows we need gateway as well. To set up dataflows I followed below steps:
### Steps:
- Login to the power bi account.
- Create a new workspace, creared the workspace named Loan Default Analysis.
- Click on download and then click on Data Gateway to download the gateway. I have downloaded the standard mode gateway.
- I have named the gateway as DF1 representing the dataflows.
- I have imported the data to Microsoft SQL server and we will use SQL to create dataflows.
- The dataset table name is Loan_default
- Click on workspaces and then click on Loan Default Analysis, Now click on New Item and search Dataflows and then we have two options Gen one and Gen two.
- For this project i have used Gen one
- Then click on Add New Tables and select SQL server and provide the details to connect then click on next and select the loan_default table.
- I have named it as "DataflowsSQL_loan"

## Connecting to dataflow and getting data in power bi desktop:

### Steps:
- Login to the power bi desktop
- Click on get data
- Select dataflows and click on connect
- Click on signin and click on connect

## Loan Default dataset description:
The Loan Default Dataset contains information about borrowers who have applied for loans, along with details about their financial status, loan characteristics, and repayment behavior.

| <b>Loan Date (DD/MM/YYYY) </b> | The date the loan was issued or originated. |


## Transform Data
Added three calculated columns <b>AgeGroup</b>,<b>CreditScoreBins</b> and <b>IncomeBracket</b>  
### AgeGroup
Added AgeGroup column using below dax:

      AgeGroup = 
         SWITCH(TRUE(),
         Loan_default[Age]<=19,"Teens",
         Loan_default[Age]<=39,"Adults",
         Loan_default[Age]<=59,"Middle Age Adults",
         "Senior Citizens"
      )

### CreditScoreBins
Added CreditScoreBins using below dax:

     CreditScoreBins = 
          SWITCH(TRUE(),
          Loan_default[CreditScore]<=400,"Poor",
          Loan_default[CreditScore]<=550,"Fair",
          Loan_default[CreditScore]<=650,"Good",
          "Excellent"
      )
### IncomeBracket
Added IncomeBracket using below dax:

         Income Bracket = 
              SWITCH(TRUE(),
              Loan_default[Income]<30000, "Low Income",
              Loan_default[Income]>=30000 && Loan_default[Income]<60000, "Middle Income",
              Loan_default[Income]>=60000, "High Income"
         )  


## Create a DateMaster table:
Created the datemaster table using below dax:

               DateMaster = ADDCOLUMNS(
                  CALENDAR(FIRSTDATE(Loan_default[Loan_Date_DD_MM_YYYY]),LASTDATE(Loan_default[Loan_Date_DD_MM_YYYY])),
                  "Year", YEAR([Date]),
                  "MonthNo",MONTH([Date]),
                  "Month",FORMAT([Date],"mmm")
               )

## Data Modeling
Connect Loan_default table to the DateMaster table
