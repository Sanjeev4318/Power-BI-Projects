# Loan Default Analysis - Power BI ðŸ“Š
In this project I have used data flow as the data source and i have used the loan default dataset. 
It is a three page report and here you can see that I have used line charts, ribbon chart, decomposition tree chart and donut charts.

Click hear to view the project [Loan Default Analysis] (https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOTFkM2U0N2ItNjljNy00NTE3LTk1MDctYzdlZjU4NDBlYjZjIiwidCI6IjdlY2YxODc3LWY5NmMtNGE1My05YTJjLTIxMWMyZDUwNGViNiJ9&pageName=53e6e13af8b118cc2309).

## Data Source : Dataflows (Setting Up Dataflows)

To use dataflows we need gateway as well. To set up dataflows I followed below steps:
### Steps:
- Login to the power bi account.
- Create a new workspace, creared the workspace named Loan Default Analysis.
- Click on download and then click on Data Gateway to download the gateway. I have downloaded the standard mode gateway.
- I have named the gateway as DF1 representing the dataflows.
- I have imported the data to Microsoft SQL server and we will use SQL to create dataflows.
- The dataset table name is Loan_default
- Click on workspaces and then click on Loan Default Analysis, Now click on New Item and search Dataflows and then we have two options Gen one and Gen two.
- For this project i have used Gen one
- Then click on Add New Tables and select SQL server and provide the details to connect then click on next and select the loan_default table.
- I have named it as "DataflowsSQL_loan"

## Connecting to dataflow and getting data in power bi desktop:

### Steps:
- Login to the power bi desktop
- Click on get data
- Select dataflows and click on connect
- Click on signin and click on connect
- Now click on load 

## Loan Default dataset description:
The Loan Default Dataset contains information about borrowers who have applied for loans, along with details about their financial status, loan characteristics, and repayment behavior.

| Column Name  | Defination |

| <b>LoanID</b> | A unique identifier for each loan in the dataset. |
| <b>Age</b> | The borrower's age at the time the loan was issued. |
| <b>Income</b> | The borrower's annual income |
| <b>LoanAmount</b> | The total amount of the loan that the borrower is requesting or has been approved for. |
| <b>CreditScore </b> | A numerical representation of the borrower's creditworthiness, typically ranging from 300 to 850. A higher credit score indicates the borrower is more likely to repay the debt. |
| <b> MonthsEmployed</b> | The number of months the borrower has been employed at their current job or with their current employer. |
| <b>NumCreditLines </b> | The total number of active credit lines (e.g., credit cards, loans) the borrower has at the time of applying for the loan. |

| <b> LoanTerm</b> | The length of time (in months) over which the loan is to be repaid. |
| <b>DTIRatio </b> | The Debt-to-Income ratio, which measures the borrowerâ€™debt payments relative to their income. A higher ratio can indicate greater financial stress. |
| <b> Education</b> | The highest level of education the borrower has completed (e.g., High School, Bachelorâ€™s, Masterâ€™s, etc.). |
| <b>EmploymentType </b> | The type of employment the borrower is engaged in (e.g., Full-Time, Part-Time, Self-Employed, etc.). |

| <b> LoanPurpose</b> | The primary reason for taking out the loan (e.g., Home Purchase, Debt Consolidation, Education, etc.). |
| <b>HasCoSigner </b> | An  indicator (e.g., Yes/No) that shows whether the borrower has a co-signer for the loan (someone who agrees to take responsibility if the borrower defaults). |
| <b> Default</b> | An  indicator (e.g., Yes/No) that shows whether the borrower defaulted on the loan or failed to make timely payments. |
| <b>Loan Date (DD/MM/YYYY) </b> | The date the loan was issued or originated. |


## Transform Data
Added three calculated columns <b>AgeGroup</b>,<b>CreditScoreBins</b> and <b>IncomeBracket</b>  
### AgeGroup
Added AgeGroup column using below dax:

      AgeGroup = 
         SWITCH(TRUE(),
         Loan_default[Age]<=19,"Teens",
         Loan_default[Age]<=39,"Adults",
         Loan_default[Age]<=59,"Middle Age Adults",
         "Senior Citizens"
      )

### CreditScoreBins
Added CreditScoreBins using below dax:

     CreditScoreBins = 
          SWITCH(TRUE(),
          Loan_default[CreditScore]<=400,"Poor",
          Loan_default[CreditScore]<=550,"Fair",
          Loan_default[CreditScore]<=650,"Good",
          "Excellent"
      )
### IncomeBracket
Added IncomeBracket using below dax:

         Income Bracket = 
              SWITCH(TRUE(),
              Loan_default[Income]<30000, "Low Income",
              Loan_default[Income]>=30000 && Loan_default[Income]<60000, "Middle Income",
              Loan_default[Income]>=60000, "High Income"
         )  


## Create a DateMaster table:
Created the datemaster table using below dax:

               DateMaster = ADDCOLUMNS(
                  CALENDAR(FIRSTDATE(Loan_default[Loan_Date_DD_MM_YYYY]),LASTDATE(Loan_default[Loan_Date_DD_MM_YYYY])),
                  "Year", YEAR([Date]),
                  "MonthNo",MONTH([Date]),
                  "Month",FORMAT([Date],"mmm")
               )

## Data Modeling
Connect Loan_default table to the DateMaster table

## Setting up Schedule Refresh for the dataflow:
In this project we are using SQL server as a data soruce, so it is important that when data gets updated in SQL Server it should be updated in dataflows as well:

### Steps:
- Login to the power bi account.
- Click on the workspace.
- Click on Schedule icon.  
![DataFlow1_SC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b35af075-c8b4-49cd-a79a-149edfb53495)
- Click on refresh, select the time zone, select refresh frequency then select time then click on Apply.
- To check refresh history, click on workspace the click on three dots in dataflows and then click on Refresh History.


## Setting up Incremental Refresh for the dataflow:
To apply incremental refresh we need one datetime column in dataset. We can change the date column to date time column in power query or in power bi service.
Click on dataflows then click on edit on the right hand side upper cornor then click on the date column and change the type from date to datetime.
### Steps:
- Click on dataflows
- Click on incremental refresh icon
 ![IncrementalRefresh_SC1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8035c40b-ebbd-4521-8008-4362d9cad87d)
- Change the toggle swith to on, select the date time column in Choose a column now here you can define the store rows from the past.
- Now select the time period in years i have selected 5 Years.
- Then you have to define a refresh period, Let's say you want only last ten days data to be refreshed.
  So you can mention ten and choose the period as days.
- Let's say the data is getting refreshed for the latest ten days.So two things will happen.
  The data for latest ten days will get refreshed.
  And with respect to the latest date, only five years data years data will be retained.  
- Then you have the option to detect the data changes, check this box and you can choose a column.
- Then here we have one more option.Only refresh complete days. Click on the check box.

> [!NOTE]  
> This data flow contains tables with active incremental refresh policies, which require power BI premium to refresh to enable refresh,
> upgrade this workspace to premium capacity.
